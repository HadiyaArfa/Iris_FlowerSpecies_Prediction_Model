# Iris_FlowerSpecies_Prediction_Model
 Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Train a KNN or logistic regression classifier on the training data. Evaluate the classifier on the testing data. We can use the accuracy of the classifier as a measure of its performance. Use the classifier to predict the species of new iris flowers.
