# Iris_FlowerSpecies_Prediction_Model
To classify the species of flowers from the Iris dataset using KNN or logistic regression, we can follow these steps:

Load the Iris dataset. The Iris dataset is a publicly available dataset that contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for 150 iris flowers. The flowers are classified into three species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets. We will use 80% of the data for training and 20% of the data for testing.
Train a KNN or logistic regression classifier on the training data.
Evaluate the classifier on the testing data. We can use the accuracy of the classifier as a measure of its performance.
Use the classifier to predict the species of new iris flowers.
